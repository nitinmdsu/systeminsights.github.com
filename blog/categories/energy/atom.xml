    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Industrial energy consumers in Tamil Nadu, India have seen a sharp increase in energy costs beginning from April 2012. In this post we look at the revised tariff of the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB), and examine its impact on the overall energy costs for a manufacturing plant.</p>

<h2>The Tariff</h2>

<p>The revised Tariff for Industrial Consumers (HT1A) is as follows (available <a href="http://tnerc.tn.nic.in/orders/Tariff%20Order%202009/2012/T.O%20No.%201%20of%202012%20dated%2030-03-2012.pdf">here</a>):</p>

<h3>Basic Charges</h3>

<ul>
<li>Demand Charges -- INR 300 / kVA / month</li>
<li>Energy Charges -- INR 5.50 / kWh</li>
</ul>


<h3>Restrictions and Surchages</h3>

<h4>Power Factor:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Power Factor => 0.9 -- No Surcharge</li>
<li>0.9 > Power Factor => 0.85    -- 1% of Current Consumption Charges for every 0.01 reduction in PF from 0.9</li>
<li>0.85 > Power Factor => 0.75 -- 1.5% of Current Consumption Charges for every 0.01 reduction in PF from 0.9</li>
<li>Power Factor &lt; 0.75 -- 2% of Current Consumption Charges for every 0.01 reduction in PF from 0.9</li>
</ul>


<h4>Billable Demand:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Demand Charges will levied on Maximum Demand that has actually been registered for the month or 90% of the Sanctioned Demand, whichever is higher.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Peak Hour:</h4>

<ul>
<li>HT Industrial Consumers will be billed 20% extra on the Energy Charges for the Energy recorded during the Peak hours</li>
<li>Duration of Peak hours will be 6:00am to 9:00am &amp; 6:00pm to 9:00pm</li>
</ul>


<h4>Night Hour:</h4>

<ul>
<li>HT Industrial Consumers will get a reduction of 5% on the Energy Charges for the Energy recorded during the Night hours</li>
<li>Duration of Night hour will be 10:00pm to 5:00am</li>
</ul>


<h4>Demand Integration Period:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Maximum Demand Integration period will be 15minutes</li>
</ul>


<h4>Harmonics:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Total Voltage Harmonic Distortion should not exceed 5%</li>
<li>Total Current Harmonic Distortion should not exceed 8%</li>
<li>If the harmonics level are not within the limits, then the consumer has to pay 15% of respective tariff as Compensation</li>
</ul>


<h2>Power Scenario in the State</h2>

<p>The state of Tamil Nadu has installed capacity of 10,364.5 MW and the average power availability is about 8500 MW. The demand ranges from 11,500 MW to 12,500 MW which gives a clear indication that the state has a shortage about 3000 to 4000 MW of power. Moreover if we see the growth of consumers, it keeps increasing at a rate of 5% every year. Because of this gap between demand and supply, TNEB has taken the following mitigation measures:</p>

<ul>
<li>40% cut on demand and energy for High Tension Industrial and Commercial Services</li>
<li>Load shedding of 2 hrs in Chennai and its suburbs</li>
<li>Load shedding of 4 hrs in other urban and rural areas</li>
<li>10% of power supply during Peak hours for Industrial and Commercial Services</li>
<li>Power Holiday for all HT &amp; LT consumers</li>
</ul>


<p>These restrictions can be relaxed based on the power availability. However, HT consumers are allowed to make power purchase to inter- and intra-state Open Access providers where cheaper power may be available.</p>

<h2>So... What's the Impact?</h2>

<p>Lets examine how these revised prices impact an average manufacturing plant.</p>

<p>Lets consider a Manufacturing Facility, with the following cost structure:</p>

<ul>
<li>Permitted Demand: 1000 kVA</li>
<li>Permitted Energy Quota: 300,000 kWh</li>
</ul>


<p>Based on this structure, lets assume that the energy consumed and the costs incurred during a representative month is as follows:</p>

<iframe width='410' height='500' frameborder='0' src='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AjFwRioMlxbbdEptNTRoLVdtQUpsa1pIMW9NSXl5S1E&single=true&gid=0&output=html&widget=true'></iframe>


<p>Lets see how costs change with the new pricing under different scenarios:</p>

<h3>Case 1: Grid Only</h3>

<p>The revised grid costs are Rs. 5.50/kWh and the plant faces a 40% reduction on its demand and energy limits. The revised permitted demand is 600 kVA and the permitted energy is 180,000 kWH. The plant is penalized at twice the price for exceeding the energy or demand limits.</p>

<iframe width='410' height='600' frameborder='0' src='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AjFwRioMlxbbdEptNTRoLVdtQUpsa1pIMW9NSXl5S1E&single=true&gid=1&output=html&widget=true'></iframe>


<p>If the plant is purely dependent on the grid (EB), then monthly energy costs grow by more than 120% (more than doubles!!!).</p>

<h3>Case 2: Grid and Diesel</h3>

<p>If the plant offsets 500 kVA of demand and 130,000 kWh of energy by running a diesel generator, which costs Rs. 15/kWh:</p>

<iframe width='410' height='650' frameborder='0' src='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AjFwRioMlxbbdEptNTRoLVdtQUpsa1pIMW9NSXl5S1E&single=true&gid=2&output=html&widget=true'></iframe>


<p>Even with using an auxilliary Diesel Generator to supplement grid energy, the plant spends 82% more on energy.</p>

<h3>Case 3: Grid and Power Purchase</h3>

<p>The plant purchases 130,000 kWh at Rs. 8/kWh, and gets a equivalent deemed demand of 260 kVA:</p>

<iframe width='410' height='700' frameborder='0' src='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AjFwRioMlxbbdEptNTRoLVdtQUpsa1pIMW9NSXl5S1E&single=true&gid=3&output=html&widget=true'></iframe>


<p>The plant still sees an increase of about 60% after purchasing power from third party suppliers.</p>

<h2>What do we do?</h2>

<p>Its clear that there are no simple ways of reducing or even maintaining energy costs at the "pre-hike" levels in Chennai. Simply changing the energy source to Diesel is not an option either, and buying third-party power can be just as expensive as using energy from the TNEB grid. What this calls for is more aggressive and hands-on management of energy consumption in the manufacturing facility, looking at which machines and systems consume the most energy, and finding ways to decrease their usage. Our vimana platform does just this and we will be back with a followup post on how <a href="http://www.systeminsights.com/vimana">vimana</a> can be applied in improving energy efficiency and reducing energy costs in a manufacturing facility.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The BEC standard discussed in the last post was applied in comparing the performance of three similar small-sized Lathes. The three devices were as follows (all brand names anonymized to protect the innocent!):</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012-02-08-BEC-Case-Study-1-A.png"></p>

<p>The test conditions were as follows:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012-02-08-BEC-Case-Study-1-B.png"></p>

<p>The BEC metric for the three devices is as follows:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012-02-08-BEC-Case-Study-1-C.png"></p>

<p>Here is how the metric looks broken down into its components:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012-02-08-BEC-Case-Study-1-D.png"></p>

<p>The results showed that Device A consumes significantly less energy than Device B and Device C. Extrapolating the BEC metric, the estimated annual energy usage for these machine tools can be calculated assuming that each device operates for 8,000 hours per year at a cost of US $0.09 per kWh of energy; similarly, the Carbon Footprint of the devices is also calculated, assuming a footprint of 0.6 kg CO2-eq/kWh. As we can see in the table below, selecting Device A saves more than $800/year compared to Device C, and $400/year compared to Device B.</p>

    <id>http://www.manufacturingbigdata.com/blog/2012/01/17/Baseline-Energy-Consumption</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Measuring machine tool energy consumption has always been tricky because of the diversity and complexity of machine tools. We took a first stab at developing a standard to measure machine tool energy consumption as part of a project supported by General Dynamics – OTS, National Center for Defense Manufacturing and Machining (NCDMM), and AMT. We developed the Baseline Energy Consumption (BEC) metric as a standard measure of the energy consumption of machine tools along with a companion test methodology. Applications of this metric include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Estimating the approximate energy requirements of operating a machine tool to manufacture a specific part</li>
<li>Comparing the energy requirements of two machine tools that are being applied in similar activities</li>
<li>Performing Return-on-Investment calculations to justify energy efficiency improvements in machine tool and machining technologies</li>
<li>Assessing environmental impact of manufacturing processes from equipment energy consumption</li>
</ul>


<p>A key consideration in designing the test methodology was to ensure that they could be performed within a reasonable amount of a time in a standard industrial setting without requiring any special workpieces, fixtures, or equipment. This pragmatic approach was explicitly selected because the goal of this metric is to serve as a figure of merit for the energy consumption of machine tools and manufacturing equipment. This metric does not intend to serve as a precise indication of the energy required by a machine tool to manufacture a specific part or to execute a specific operation. The first edition of the standard focused on measuring the BEC of lathe-type machine tools based on recording the power consumption during a series of controlled tests.</p>

<p>The energy consumption of a machine tool in a factory environment is determined by the relative time it spends in different states, including, idle, axes movement, and cutting. To capture the effect of these states, the baseline tests measure the average power consumption during tare usage, axes / component usage, and machining usage. Tare usage is measured based on the power consumption of the machine tool when it is in standby with its peripheral units turned on. Component usage is measured based on the power consumption when the machine tool components are being exercised, without any loaded workpiece (analogous to “air-cutting”). Machining usage is measured based on power consumption  during metal cutting at a fixed spindle speed at varying material removal rates on an arbitrary workpiece. These tests are based on the observation that the energy required to remove unit volume of material in a machine tool is largely dependent on the volumetric rate of removal, or material removal rate, and not on the process parameters.</p>

<p>The BEC metric is based on the average power consumed during these states. The three terms are weighted by duration factors to estimate the energy consumed by the machine during one hour of representative operation, where it is assumed that the machine tool spends 25% of the duration in tare usage, 25% in component usage (air-cutting/warmup etc.,) and 50% in machining usage.</p>

<p>We will be following up with case studies looking at how this standard was applied in comparing different machine tools.</p>
