We are very happy to announce that we will be partnering with [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com) during [IMTS](http://www.imts.com/) to showcase integrated solutions for manufacturing data interoperability, collection, and analysis. We will be discussing the use of Java SE Embedded in building a ubiquitous embedded platform for collecting data from the shopfloor. [Java SE Embedded](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/overview/javase/index.html) has been used in products across a diverse spectrum of industries, ranging from RFID readers to parking meters to ATMs to in-flight video systems to POS terminals to wearable systems. This makes it a great fit in the manufacturing world, where we need hardware devices that can seamlessly and ubiquitously integrate data across the shop floor.

Java SE Embedded will be applied in developing a hardware platform that can collect data across proprietary interfaces in the shopfloor, perform basic analysis, and then stream it in the MTConnect standard. Selecting MTConnect was a no-brainer â€“ it is widely supported by the industry, it is lightweight and easy to implement, and gives us a lot of flexibility in deployment. MTConnect is also natively supported by our [vimana](http://www.systeminsights.com) platform for manufacturing big data analysis, and MTConnect allows us to quickly integrate the factory data feeds for further analysis and reporting using vimana. 

We are very excited about our partnership with Oracle, and will be talking more about it at IMTS. You can catch us Booth N-6995 with Oracle, between September 10th and 15th, at McCormick Place, Chicago.
