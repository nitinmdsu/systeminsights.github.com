I am back to my regular blogging duties after a hiatus of a few months. 

Part of the reason I was away was because I was teaching the graduate course "Precision Manufacturing" at UC Berkeley in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. 

Thanks to the webcast facilities at Cal, videos of all of the classroom lectures are available on Youtube [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqxpT3GBB8U&list=PLbCV7-4PxKsQJ7VtY13oipOEDrCVXdkhy). If you have any questions or feedback, please leave it in the comments!
